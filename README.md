# Kiggyshop [![Rust and Elm CI](https://github.com/FayCarsons/Kiggyshop/actions/workflows/shop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FayCarsons/Kiggyshop/actions/workflows/shop.yml)
An example of a fully functional, production-ready stack.

The frontend is written in Elm, and the backend in Rust using Actix Web. 

It can be run with: `cd backend && cargo run` 
And in another process: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

We are aiming for a release in Q4 2024.
